# Data_Analysis

Working to analyze large amounts of lab data to track trends. 

Using Juypter Notebooks.

My report with Lab Standard Data, was my first python project outside of tutorials. This data may have been more presentable as a Jupyter Notebooke, but instead was used to generate a power point report.
